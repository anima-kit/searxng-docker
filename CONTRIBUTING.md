   - Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.
   - Reference related issues in your PR description.
   - Keep commits small and focused on a single purpose.
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.

## Communication, Testing, Documentation

- First, discuss major changes in an issue before submitting PRs.
