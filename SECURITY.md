# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately through GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature.**

To report a security issue:
1. Go to the **Security** tab in this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with details about the issue

You can also navigate directly to [Github's Private Vulnerability Reporting][security-report].

## Why Private Reporting?

- **Protects other users**: Vulnerabilities are fixed before they can be exploited
- **Responsible disclosure**: Gives you time to investigate and patch
- **Confidentiality**: Your report remains private until patched

## Collaboration Process

When you report a security issue:
1. I'll acknowledge receipt and confirm understanding of the problem
2. We'll work together (if desired) to develop and test a fix
3. The fix will be implemented and verified
4. A security advisory will be published with details and credit

## What You Can Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: I'll try to acknowledge your report within 1-2 weeks
- **Collaborative fixing**: I'll work with you (if desired) to understand and resolve the issue
- **Regular updates**: I'll keep you informed of progress (if desired)
- **Public disclosure**: Once fixed, I'll publicly document the vulnerability and solution
- **Credit**: I'll give appropriate credit for responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Responsible Disclosure

I believe in responsible disclosure:
- Reporting vulnerabilities privately first
- Allowing time for a fix before public disclosure
- Providing clear information about the vulnerability and how it's fixed
- Respecting the time and effort of security researchers

## Your Role

When reporting, please include:
- Clear reproduction steps
- Impact assessment 
- Any potential workarounds
- Your contact information (optional)

## Response Time

I'll make reasonable efforts to acknowledge and address security reports within 1-2 weeks of receipt.
